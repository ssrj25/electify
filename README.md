# Electify: Decentralized Online Voting Application

## Problem Statement

Youth participation in elections is declining, especially in India where the majority population is aged 20-25. The current offline voting system is inefficient, costly, and can lead to voter coercion. Voters need a secure, anonymous way to vote from home.

## Solution

Electify leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized online voting system. By connecting voters directly to their electoral ward's poll, the system reduces the number of nodes in the blockchain, minimizing gas fees for each transaction.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Blockchain Network Selection**: Identifying suitable networks and private Ethereum account creation services that avoid real-life costs for each transaction. MetaMask, Polygon TestNet, Truffle, and Ganache were shortlisted.
2. **Decentralization vs. Efficiency**: Balancing Web3’s decentralized nature with the need for individual blockchain networks for each ward.

## Tracks Applied

### Ethereum Track

Utilizes Ethereum blockchain technology for managing transactions.

### Ethereum + Polygon Track

Incorporates the Polygon network to enhance Ethereum’s capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **React**
- **Node.js**
- **JavaScript**
- **Web3**
- **Ethereum**
- **Blockchain**
